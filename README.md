##### A Quote of Niklas Luhmann's farewell lecture 1993:
> _"[Empiricism and statistics] looks, if you look at it from the outside, like the production of a self-constructed certainty, like the production of a construction. If one analyzes it epistemologically, one would perhaps guess at an operative constructivism. On the other hand, empirical sociologists cannot forget to suggest that their measurements are reality, so that reality is actually always behind the data. But you can't reach it directly either, otherwise you would duplicate what is there, instead you want to use techniques to find out more about reality. But that comes from behind, from an unexplored reality."_
